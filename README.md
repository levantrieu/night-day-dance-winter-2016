# Day and Night Dance: Community Project

**Project Brief**

This is a team effort for the RED Academy community project in partnership with the User Experience class. Day and Night Dance offer dance lessons in multiple locations in Western Canada. We built a custom theme, based on the UX comps, on the WordPress platform for Day and Night Dance. We created custom post types, taxonomies and loops to pull content. The goal for this site is to make it as easy for content management in the future as possible.
